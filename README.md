- limited type checking has been implemented thus far via typescript.  Usage: `npm run type-check`.  (Strict mode is currently off, although I don't think there is enough .ts to have encountered issues yet :))
- on github https://github.com/dlarbi/beyond-calendar/
- the .git directory is in the compressed/submitted filesystem.  (It is a hidden file in my macOS, revealed by shift+cmd+.)
